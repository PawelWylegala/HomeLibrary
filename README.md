# Library

~~~
A simple console application that allows us to add/remove books or movies to specific categories. 
Later we can view our list of books/movies. 
First, we need to create a category so that we can later add individual books or movies to it.

Allowed commands: help, quite, category, book, movie
Allowed action for command <category>: list, add, del.
Command pattern for help, quit: <command>
Command pattern for book/movie: <command> <action> <param1> <param2>

    Example: book add  -> BookName add CategoryName
             book del  -> BookName del CategoryName
             book list -> list of books
